# Fullstack project

DEADLINE:

## Read this section carefully.

At this point you have two repositories:

Frontend and backend code:

1. [fs17-frontend](https://github.com/Integrify-Finland/fs17-Frontend-project)
2. [fs17-backend](https://github.com/Integrify-Finland/fs17-backend)

You should `NOT` copy paste the code to this repo instead do this:

1. Open a PR in your frontend and backend
2. Copy the links of the both PRs
3. Open a PR here and leave as a comment both links

Backend project is a team project so:

1. Fork the repo you have been working with. For instance if you are in team 1 you would fork the [forked repo](https://github.com/daniloccangucu/fs17-backend/tree/danilo)
